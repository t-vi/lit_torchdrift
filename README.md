# TorchDrift component for Lightning

This is a [Lightning](https://lightning.ai/) component for [TorchDrift](https://torchdrift.org/).

The component takes a calibrated detector (for now, moving calibration to the component is work in progress) and an E-Mail-Sending component to sound the alarm if needed.
